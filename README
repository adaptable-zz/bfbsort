Standard bubble-sort type algorithm implemented in brainfuck.

This is amusingly inefficient since comparison requires repeatedly decrementing
both values to see which hits zero first. Basically each comparison is an
elaborate swap (which also requires repeated incrementing/decrementing) that
leaves the values in the correct order.

This code was tested on the bff brainfuck interpreter, which uses -1 for EOF.
Some interpreters/compilers use 0; as far as I know there is no definitive
specification of this aspect of the language.
